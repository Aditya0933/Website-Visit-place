                <p class="cont-para p-position-absolute"><span class="span">(';') <b> &nbsp; Srinagar &nbsp; </b> (';')</span> <br>Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir is located in the heart of the Kashmir valley at an
                    altitude of 1,730 m above sea level. Spread on both sides of the river Jhelum the city is famous for
                    its natural beauty, gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. Srinagar is called the city of lakes and
                        the Venice of the East, fascinating tourists from centuries. The very absence of order in the location of the houses and their tumbled down
                        appearance add a peculiar charm to the scenery. It has its own quaint lifestyle, telling a panoramic
                        fairytale tour through the snow-capped mountains and Chinar trees, while enjoying the adventurous
                        pleasures of hiking, mountain biking, and rafting. The city is also famous for traditional Kashmiri
                        handicrafts and dried fruits.</p>

                <p class="cont-para p-position-absolute"><span class="span">(';') <b> &nbsp; Delhi &nbsp; </b> (';')</span> <br>The National Capital Delhi is rightly called the very heart of India. Bustling streets, vibrant
                    locals, historic grandeur, modern charm, splendid food items, and blissful cultures – Delhi is all
                    this and a lot more. The vividness of this city is such that one needs more than a lifetime to
                    explore it inch by inch. From sky scraping multinational companies redefining the word modern to
                    colonial-era buildings narrating legendary stories of the past, the contrast seen here is
                    unbelievable</p>

                    south and the Kashmir valley to the west. Strategically placed on ancient trade routes, Ladakh lies
                    between the Kunlun Mountains in the north and the Himalayas in the south. The region originally
                    comprised the Baltistan valley, the Indus Valley, Zanskar, Lahaul, Spiti, Aksai Chin and Ngari</p>

                <p class="cont-para p-position-absolute"><span class="span">(';') <b> &nbsp; Munnar &nbsp; </b> (';')</span> <br>The south-west state of India, Kerala is one of the major tourist destinations in the country with
                    its silvery coast, serpentine backwaters, coconut grove swaying to the south-west wind and Western
                    Ghats covered in aromatic spice and tea plantation. There is no dearth of places to see in Kerala
                    and Munnar is one such place. Located at about 5,200 ft above the sea level, Munnar is a beautiful
                    hill station in the district of Idukki, Kerala. Once the summer resort for the British, Munnar is
                    known for its pleasant climate and pristine beauty. The rolling hills covered in mist intersected by
                    the winding road, the dark emerald green coloured plantation and the few lone houses in midst of it
                    will instantly make you fall in love with this place. Munnar is a very popular destination among the
                    honeymooners. It is also an ideal place for nature lovers, wildlife lovers and adventure enthusiasts

                <h1 class="cant-heading">5. Jaisalmer</h1>
                <p class="cont-para p-position-absolute"><span class="span">(';') <b> &nbsp; Jaisalmer &nbsp; </b> (';')</span> <br>Jaisalmer literally means ‘the Hill Fort of Jaisal’. The desert city is also called the Golden city
                    thanks to the color it gets from the yellow sandstone used for construction of the buildings.
                    Jaisalmar is one the last big towns in Rajasthan closest to the India-Pakistan border and stands in
                    the heart of the Thar Desert. Jaisalmer has come a long ways since being an important town along the
                    ancient camel-train route ran through India and Central Asia. Over the centuries, the fortunes of
                    Jaisalmer have risen and fallen thanks to the geo-politics of the region and, of course, emergence
                    of newer trading routes. The rise in sea trade, especially during the British Era, lent a crippling
                    blow to Jaisalmer. With Independence and the resulting hostility with Pakistan it seemed like
                    Jaisalmer would fall off the map sooner rather than later. But it was during India’s darkest hour
                    that Jaisalmer’s fortunes rose once again. During India’s wars with Pakistan in 1965 and again in
                    1971 the Indian government realized the importance of Jaisalmer’s strategic position along the
                    border.

                    the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh, its snow covered peaks make it a popular honeymoon
                    destination. Considered the twin town of Kullu, Manali’s scenic beauty, history and culture give it
                    the sobriquet of the Valley of the Gods. When hippies flocked the city in the ’60s and ’70s in
                    pursuit of their utopian dream, Manali became very popular in the west.</p>

                    important corridors of passage between Sikkim and Tibet are worth a visit. ANother point of interest
                    is Mt. Khangchendzonga floating high over the cloud-covered lower Himalaya and dominating the
                    landscape of Sikkim. At 28, 208 ft is the third highest mountain in the world and the highest in
                    India.</p>
